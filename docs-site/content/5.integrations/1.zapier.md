# Zapier Integration

Connect your Velvet waitlist to 5,000+ apps using Zapier. Automate your workflows when users sign up, refer others, or get offboarded from your waitlist.

## What is Zapier?

[Zapier](https://zapier.com) is a web-based automation tool that connects various apps and services to streamline workflows. It allows users to create automated actions, known as "Zaps," between different applications without needing to code.

## Common Use Cases

Customers use Velvet's Zapier integration to:

- **Sync to CRM**: Automatically add new signups to HubSpot, Salesforce, or Airtable
- **Email Marketing**: Add users to Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or Klaviyo email lists
- **Notifications**: Get Slack or Discord notifications for each new signup
- **Analytics**: Track signups in Google Sheets or Notion databases
- **Personalized Outreach**: Trigger automated email sequences when users are offboarded

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Enable Zapier Integration

1. Log into your Velvet Dashboard
2. Select your waitlist
3. Navigate to **Connectors** in the sidebar
4. Toggle **Enable Zapier Integration** to ON

## Troubleshooting

### Zaps Not Triggering

1. Ensure Zapier integration is **enabled** in your Connectors settings
2. Verify your Zapier API key is correct
3. Check that your Zap is turned **ON** in Zapier
4. Try submitting a test signup from your widget

### Authentication Errors

If Zapier reports authentication issues:

1. Go to **Connectors** in your Velvet dashboard
2. Click the **regenerate** button next to your Zapier API Key
3. Update the key in your Zapier connection settings

### Timeout Errors

Zapier requests timeout after:
- 30 seconds to establish a connection

If you experience timeouts, ensure your Zapier workflows are optimized for speed.
